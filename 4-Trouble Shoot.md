# Deployment Report – Node.js API on Azure App Service (Windows)

## Overview

This document summarizes the troubleshooting steps and current findings for deploying a Node.js API to **Azure App Service (Windows)**.

---

## 1 - Network and Log Access

- Attempt Azure CLI Log Tail `az login`: Tried `az webapp log tail` to access logs.

- Confirm App Service Name: Corrected the app name (helloapi-test instead of the autogenerated hostname) and re-ran the az webapp log tail command.

- Diagnose the CLI SSL Error: `az webapp log tail --name helloapi-test --resource-group helloapi-test_group --no-verify`

## 2- Root Cause Analysis and Resolution

- Use Kudu Debug Console: Used the Kudu `Development" -> Advanced Tools` to access the browser-based terminal via `HTTP`, bypassing the SSL-blocked log stream.

- You can access your App Service's file system through the `Kudu debug console`, which provides direct terminal access on Windows.

- Click the `Debug console` menu at the top, then select `CMD` or `PowerShell`.
- Navigate to site/wwwroot by running `cd /home/site/wwwroot` in the console.
- List your files by running dir to ensure your `app.js` and `package.json` are present.
- View the web.config file by running `type web.config`. This is a crucial step for a `Windows Node.js app`, as a misconfiguration in this file is a very common cause of 404 errors.
